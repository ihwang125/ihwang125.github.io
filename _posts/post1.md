# Why and How I Created My Site

## Why

1. I want to record my ideas and actually publish them in the world, regardless of whether I think they are good enough. Just sharing genuine ideas, regardless of unoriginality provides value of its own kind.
2. I want to practice my written communication skills
3. I needed a place to provide documentation on projects and share them with other people. I wanted to make it my own.
4. Having a self-managed site is cool.

## How 

I use Jekyll as a SSG to provide easy ways to add new pages, and to add a theme to my site: dark-poole
